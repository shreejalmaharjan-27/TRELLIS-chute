<span style="font-size: 16px; font-weight: 600;">T</span><span style="font-size: 12px; font-weight: 700;">RELLIS</span> is a large 3D asset generation model. It takes in text or image prompts and generates high-quality 3D assets in various formats, such as Radiance Fields, 3D Gaussians, and meshes. The cornerstone of <span style="font-size: 16px; font-weight: 600;">T</span><span style="font-size: 12px; font-weight: 700;">RELLIS</span> is a unified Structured LATent (<span style="font-size: 16px; font-weight: 600;">SL</span><span style="font-size: 12px; font-weight: 700;">AT</span>) representation that allows decoding to different output formats and Rectified Flow Transformers tailored for <span style="font-size: 16px; font-weight: 600;">SL</span><span style="font-size: 12px; font-weight: 700;">AT</span> as the powerful backbones. We provide large-scale pre-trained models with up to 2 billion parameters on a large 3D asset dataset of 500K diverse objects. <span style="font-size: 16px; font-weight: 600;">T</span><span style="font-size: 12px; font-weight: 700;">RELLIS</span> significantly surpasses existing methods, including recent ones at similar scales, and showcases flexible output format selection and local 3D editing capabilities which were not offered by previous models.

<!-- Features -->

## üåü Features

- **High Quality**: It produces diverse 3D assets at high quality with intricate shape and texture details.
- **Versatility**: It takes text or image prompts and can generate various final 3D representations including but not limited to _Radiance Fields_, _3D Gaussians_, and _meshes_, accommodating diverse downstream requirements.
- **Flexible Editing**: It allows for easy editings of generated 3D assets, such as generating variants of the same object or local editing of the 3D asset.

<!-- Updates -->

## ‚è© Updates

**03/25/2025**

- Release training code.
- Release **TRELLIS-text** models and asset variants generation.
  - Examples are provided as [example_text.py](example_text.py) and [example_variant.py](example_variant.py).
  - Gradio demo is provided as [app_text.py](app_text.py).
  - _Note: It is always recommended to do text to 3D generation by first generating images using text-to-image models and then using TRELLIS-image models for 3D generation. Text-conditioned models are less creative and detailed due to data limitations._

**12/26/2024**

- Release [**TRELLIS-500K**](https://github.com/microsoft/TRELLIS#-dataset) dataset and toolkits for data preparation.

**12/18/2024**

- Implementation of multi-image conditioning for **TRELLIS-image** model. ([#7](https://github.com/microsoft/TRELLIS/issues/7)). This is based on tuning-free algorithm without training a specialized model, so it may not give the best results for all input images.
- Add Gaussian export in `app.py` and `example.py`. ([#40](https://github.com/microsoft/TRELLIS/issues/40))
